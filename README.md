# Breast-Mass-Detection-and-Classi-cation-via-YOLOv5-Models

With recent breakthroughs in deep learning, the use of Deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) in healthcare, especially in medical imaging has achieved remarkable success. Besides that, accurate breast mass detection and classification in mammograms is still a critical challenge because of several reasons, for instance, the heterogeneity of breast masses and the complexity of surrounding environment. In this report, an end-to-end system for localization and classification of suspicious breast lesions from entire mammograms is presented. The system is based on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) object detection model. The suggested system converts mammograms from DICOM format to pictures without sacrificing data. Then, without any human intervention, it detects masses in full-field digital mammograms and distinguishes between MALIGNANT and BENIGN tumours. In this project, YOLOv5, which is the latest version of YOLO algorithm is used. The model is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, with 1127 mammograms from Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and 106 mammograms from INbreast database. We have experimented with all 4 different models of YOLOv5 and our best results reached an mAP@IoU=0.5 36.4% on unseen breast mammograms.
